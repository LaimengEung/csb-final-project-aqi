.locations - Find Monitoring Stations
    # What you get from each location:
    location = locations.results[0]
    location.id              # Unique identifier (use this to get measurements)
    location.name            # Station name (e.g., "AUPP Liger Leadership Academy")
    location.locality        # City/area name
    location.country.name    # Country name
    location.country.id      # Country ID
    location.coordinates     # Latitude/longitude object
        location.coordinates.latitude
        location.coordinates.longitude
    location.datetime_first  # When this station started reporting
    location.datetime_last   # Most recent measurement time
    location.parameters      # List of pollutants measured here

        When to use: Every time you want to search for monitoring stations 
                    by location, country, or coordinates.   

.measurements - Get Actual Air Quality Data
    # What you get from each measurement:
    measurement = measurements.results[0]
    measurement.value           # The actual reading (e.g., 35.2)
    measurement.parameter.name  # Pollutant name (e.g., "pm25")
    measurement.parameter.id    # Pollutant ID
    measurement.datetime        # When it was measured
    measurement.location.name   # Station name
    measurement.coordinates     # Where it was measured

        When to use: When you want to get the actual pollution data to analyze or visualize.

.countries - List All countries
    country = countries.results[0]
    country.id       # Country ID (needed for locations.list)
    country.name     # Country name (e.g., "United States")
    country.code     # ISO code (e.g., "US")

        When to use: When you want to let users search by country name, or to build a list of available countries.

.parameters - List All Pollutants
    parameter = parameters.results[0]
    parameter.id             # Parameter ID (e.g., 2 for PM2.5)
    parameter.name           # Parameter name (e.g., "pm25")
    parameter.display_name   # Human-readable name (e.g., "PM2.5")
    parameter.units          # Measurement unit (e.g., "µg/m³")
    Commonly used parameter IDs:

    2 = PM2.5 (fine particulate matter)
    1 = PM10 (coarse particulate matter)
    5 = NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)
    3 = O3 (ozone)
    4 = SO2 (sulfur dioxide)
    6 = CO (carbon monoxide)

        When to use: When you want to let users choose which pollutant to visualize, 
                    or to display all available pollutants for a location.
